## My code for 'The Proton Game'. The Proton Game is a console-based data-crunching game for younger and older data scientists. This game is linked with the "Pietraszko's Cave" story available at http://biecek.pl/BetaBit/Warsaw. It's a part of Beta and Bit series. You will find more about the Beta and Bit series at http://biecek.pl/BetaBit.

# Installation

## I used the free statistical software programme R (https://www.r-project.org/). Once R is up and running, download the CRAN package dplyr https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html.


# Usage

## Feel free to use whatever code you like. All I kindly ask in return is that you cite it appropriately :)
